            <p>
              Bayard "Papa Smurf" Roberts, 23, is an aspiring teenager seeking the fountain of youth.
              He likes long walks on the beach, like really long, you should probably bring a tent.
              Bayard grew up on a farm, where he learned how to fly and be superman.
              He hopes to one day have an estranged wife that he can complain about.
              You can reach him via phone or carrier pigeon, but he prefers that all business ventures to be
              routed through his agent, Barry, who lives between 1809 and 1811 on Williamsburg Blvd. in
              a box at almost all hours of the day. Donations are welcome.

            <h4>Jamie Kuppel</h4>
            <p>
              Jamie "Jamie McJamieFace" Kuppel, 21, grew up as the son of a very wealthy couple. At age 7, Jamie's
              parents were tragically gunned down in a street mugging. Heartbroken with no where to go, Jamie's butler,
              Alfred, took him in and raised him as his own. Jamie then left his new home just a few years later and
              became aquainted with the League of Shadows, and in particular the group's leader, Ra's al Ghul. Jamie then
              made his return to Gotham after years of training and began his career as the Dark Knight, successfully
              defending his home city from villains the likes of the Joker and Bane. At age 21, Jamie has retired from
              bearing the burden of city hero and now pursues a rap career as well as an active appreciation of lawn gnomes.
