            <h4>Bayard Roberts</h4>
            <p>
            Bayard "Papa Smurf" Roberts, 23, is an aspiring teenager seeking the fountain of youth.
            He likes long walks on the beach, like really long, you should probably bring a tent.
            Bayard grew up on a farm, where he learned how to fly and be superman.
            He hopes to one day have an estranged wife that he can complain about.
            You can reach him via phone or carrier pigeon, but he prefers that all business ventures to be
            routed through his agent, Barry, who lives between 1809 and 1811 on Williamsburg Blvd. in
            a box at almost all hours of the day. Donations are welcome.
